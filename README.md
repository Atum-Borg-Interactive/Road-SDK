![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0.0--alpha-orange)

> **First public release — actively under development.**  
> Road Pro is a runtime road placement system for Unity. Place, connect, and manage roads at runtime with automatic intersections, traffic lights, and street lights.

---

## Features

- **Runtime Road Placement** — Draw roads in Play Mode with mouse input
- **Automatic Intersections** — Roads that cross or meet form junctions automatically
- **Intersection Meshes** — Smooth mesh generation at junctions
- **Terrain Following** — Roads conform to terrain height
- **Lane System** — Configurable lane patterns (driving, walking)
- **Traffic Light Spawner** — Automatic traffic lights at 3+ way intersections
- **Street Light Spawner** — Automatic street lights along roads with configurable spacing
- **URP / Built-in Support** — Shaders for both pipelines
- **Modular Codebase** — Clean separation of generation, math, geometry, and Unity layers

## Installation

### Option 1: Unity Package Manager (UPM) via Git URL

1. Open `Window > Package Manager`
2. Click `+` → `Add package from git URL`
3. Paste:

```
https://github.com/Atum-Borg-Interactive/Road-SDK.git?path=Assets/RoadPro
```

Updates are handled through the Package Manager.

### Option 2: Manual Install

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `Assets/RoadPro` folder into your project's `Assets/` directory
3. The tool is ready to use

### Option 3: UnityPackage Export

*(Coming soon)*

## Quick Start

1. Open the project or import Road Pro into your project
2. Open a scene
3. Select `GameObject > Create Empty` and name it `RoadManager`
4. Add the `RoadProSetup` component (located in `Assets/RoadPro/Demo/`)
5. Enter Play Mode
6. **Left-click** to place road endpoints
7. **Right-click** to cancel placement
8. Roads automatically connect, intersections form, and traffic/street lights spawn

> **Note:** The demo script `RoadProSetup` is provided as a starting point. For full control, use the `RoadBuilder`, `TrafficLightSpawner`, and `StreetlightSpawner` components directly.

## Components Overview

### RoadBuilder
The core placement component. Handles mouse input, road creation, crossing detection, and mesh rebuilding.

### TrafficLightSpawner
Attach to the same GameObject as `RoadBuilder`. Automatically spawns traffic lights at intersections with 3 or more connected roads. Lights are placed on the right sidewalk (driver's right) of each approaching road.

**Configuration fields:**
- `offsetBackFromStop` — Distance from the stop line
- Pole/signal housing dimensions and materials

### StreetlightSpawner
Attach to the same GameObject as `RoadBuilder`. Automatically spawns street lights along both sides of every road with consistent spacing.

**Configuration fields:**
- `spacing` — Distance between lights (default: 35m)
- `offsetFromEdge` — Offset from road edge
- Pole/lamp materials
